defmodule Corsica do
  @moduledoc """
  Plug-based swiss-army knife for CORS requests.

  Corsica provides facilities for dealing with
  [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) requests
  and responses. It provides:

    * low-level functions that let you decide when and where to deal with CORS
      requests and CORS response headers;
    * a plug that handles CORS requests and responds to preflight requests;
    * a router that can be used in your modules in order to turn them into CORS
      handlers which provide fine control over dealing with CORS requests.

  ## How it works

  Corsica is compliant with the [W3C CORS
  specification](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/). As per this specification, Corsica
  doesn't put any CORS response headers in a connection that holds an invalid
  CORS request. To know what "invalid" CORS request means, have a look at the
  "Validity of CORS requests" section below.

  When some options that are not mandatory and have no default value (such
  `:max_age`) are not passed to Corsica (in one of the available ways to pass
  options to it), the relative header will often not be sent at all. This is
  compliant with the specification and at the same time it reduces the size of
  the response, even if just by a handful of bytes.

  The following is a list of all the CORS response headers supported by Corsica:

    * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`
    * `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`
    * `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`
    * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`
    * `Access-Control-Expose-Headers`
    * `Access-Control-Max-Age`

  ## Using Corsica as a plug

  When `Corsica` is used as a plug, it intercepts all requests; it only sets a
  bunch of CORS headers for regular CORS requests, but it responds (with a `200 OK`
  and the appropriate headers) to preflight requests.

  If you want to use `Corsica` as a plug, be sure to plug it in your plug
  pipeline **before** any router: routers like `Plug.Router` (or
  `Phoenix.Router`) respond to HTTP verbs as well as request urls, so if
  `Corsica` is plugged after a router then preflight requests (which are
  `OPTIONS` requests) will often result in 404 errors since no route responds to
  them.

      defmodule MyApp.Endpoint do
        plug Head
        plug Corsica, max_age: 600, origins: "*", expose_headers: ~w(X-Foo)
        plug MyApp.Router
      end

  ## Using Corsica as a router generator

  When `Corsica` is used as a plug, it doesn't provide control over which urls
  are CORS-enabled or with which options. In order to do that, you can use
  `Corsica.Router`. See the documentation for `Corsica.Router` for more
  information.

  ## Origins

  Allowed origins can be specified by passing the `:origins` options either when
  using a Corsica-based router or when plugging `Corsica` in a plug pipeline.

  `:origins` can be a single value or a list of values. `"*"` can only appear as
  a single value. The default value is `"*"`.  The origin of a request
  (specified by the `"origin"` request header) will be considered a valid origin
  if it "matches" at least one of the origins specified in `:origins`. What
  "matches" means depends on the type of origin. Origins can be:

    * strings - the actual origin and the allowed origin have to be identical
    * regexes - the actual origin has to match the allowed regex (as per
      `Regex.match?/2`)
    * `{module, function}` tuples - `module.function` is called with the actual
      origin as its only argument; if it returns `true` the origin is accepted,
      if it returns `false` the origin is not accepted

  For example:

      # Matches everything
      plug Corsica, origins: "*"

      # Matches one of the given origins
      plug Corsica, origins: ["http://foo.com", "http://bar.com"]

      # Matches the given regex
      plug Corsica, origins: ~r{^https?://(.*\.?)foo\.com$}

  ### The value of the "access-control-allow-origin" header

  The `:origins` option directly influences the value of the
  `access-control-allow-origin` response header. When `:origins` is `"*"`, the
  `access-control-allow-origin` header is set to `*` as well. If the request's
  origin is allowed and `:origins` is something different than `"*"`, then you
  won't see that value as the value of the `access-control-allow-origin` header:
  the value of this header will be the request's origin (which is *mirrored*).
  This behaviour is intentional: it's compliant with the W3C CORS specification
  and at the same time it provides the advantage of "hiding" all the allowed
  origins from the client (which only sees its origin as an allowed origin).

  ## The "vary" header

  If `:origins` is a list with more than one value and the request origin
  matches, then a `Vary: Origin` header is added to the response.

  ## Options

  Besides `:origins`, the options that can be passed to the `use` macro, to
  `Corsica.Router.resource/2` and to the `Corsica` plug (along with their default
  values) are:

    * `:allow_headers` - a list of headers (as binaries). Sets the value of
      the `access-control-allow-headers` header used with preflight requests.
      Defaults to `[]` (no headers are allowed).
    * `:allow_methods` - is a list of HTTP methods (as binaries). Sets the value
      of the `access-control-allow-methods` header used with preflight requests.
      Defaults to `["HEAD", "GET", "POST", "PUT", "PATCH", "DELETE"]`.
    * `:allow_credentials` - is a boolean. If `true`, sends the
      `access-control-allow-credentials` with value `true`. If `false`, prevents
      that header from being sent at all. If `:origins` is set to `"*"` and
      `:allow_credentials` is set to `true`, then the value of the
      `access-control-allow-origin` header will always be the value of the
      `origin` request header (as per the W3C CORS specification) and not `*`.
      Defaults to `false`.
    * `:expose_headers` - is a list of headers (as binaries). Sets the value of
      the `access-control-expose-headers` response header. This option *does
      not* have a default value; if it's not provided, the
      `access-control-expose-headers` header is not sent at all.
    * `:max_age` - is an integer or a binary. Sets the value of the
      `access-control-max-age` header used with preflight requests. This option
      *does not* have a default value; if it's not provided, the
      `access-control-max-age` header is not sent at all.
    * `:log` - see the "Logging" section below. Defaults to `false`.

  ## Responding to preflight requests

  When the request is a preflight request and a valid one (valid origin, valid
  request method, and valid request headers), Corsica directly sends a response
  to that request instead of just adding headers to the connection (so that a
  possible plug pipeline can continue). To do this, Corsica **halts the
  connection** (through `Plug.Conn.halt/1`) and **sends a response**.

  ## Validity of CORS requests

  "Invalid CORS request" can mean that a request doesn't have an `Origin` header
  (so it's not a CORS request at all) or that it's a CORS request but:

    * the `Origin` request header doesn't match any of the allowed origins
    * the request is a preflight request but it requests to use a method or
      some headers that are not allowed (via the `Access-Control-Request-Method`
      and `Access-Control-Request-Headers` headers)

  ## Logging

  Corsica supports basic logging functionalities; it can log whether a CORS
  request is a valid one, what CORS headers are added to a response and similar
  information. Corsica distinguishes between three "types" of logs:

    * "rejected" logs, for when the request is "rejected" in the CORS perspective,
      e.g., it's not allowed
    * "invalid" logs, for when the request is not a simple CORS request or not a
      CORS preflight request
    * "accepted" logs, for when the request is a valid and accepted CORS request

  It's possible to configure these logs with the `:log` option, which is a
  keyword list with the `:rejected`, `:invalid`, and `:accepted` options. These
  options specify the logging level of each type of log. The defaults values for
  each level are:

    * `rejected: :warn`
    * `invalid: :debug`
    * `accepted: :debug`

  `false` can be used as the value of a level for a log type to suppress that
  type completely. `false` can also be used as the value of the `:log` option
  directly to suppress all logs.

  The default value for the `:log` option is `false`.

  For example:

      plug Corsica, log: [rejected: :error]
      plug Corsica, log: false
      plug Corsica, log: [rejected: :info, accepted: false]

  # However, this behaviour can inhibit caching from the client side since the

  # while if all the allowed methods are returned every time then the cached
  # preflight request can be used more times.

  Sends a CORS preflight response regardless of the request being a valid CORS
  request or not.

  This function assumes nothing about `conn`. If it's a valid CORS preflight
  request with an allowed origin, CORS headers are set by calling
  `put_cors_preflight_resp_headers/2` and the response **is sent** with status
  `status` and body `body`. `conn` is **halted** before being sent.

  The response is always sent because if the request is not a valid CORS
  request, then no CORS headers will be added to the response. This behaviour
  will be interpreted by the browser as a non-allowed preflight request, as
  expected.

  For more information on what headers are sent with the response if the
